Application Description: This application enables user to add products to their cart from the catalog, checkout it, and pay for it. 

Things you did in the code: In this code, I used routing and state management to update the pages whenever the user adds something or remove to their cart. 

Challenges when developing the application: I find the exercise easier since the lab handout is very helpful when I was coding the application. The only thing that made me struggle was removing the "Pay now" button when the cart is empty.
